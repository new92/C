# The Fibonacci sequence

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number (except for the first two) is the sum of the two preceding ones. It typically starts with 0 and 1, and then each subsequent number is the sum of the two previous numbers. The sequence begins as follows:
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...
In mathematical terms, the Fibonacci sequence can be defined using the following recursive formula:
F(0) = 0
F(1) = 1
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n > 1
The sequence is named after Leonardo of Pisa, an Italian mathematician also known as Fibonacci, who introduced it to the Western world in his book "Liber Abaci" in the year 1202. Fibonacci numbers have many fascinating properties and applications in various fields, including mathematics, computer science, biology, and art. They appear in nature, art, and architecture and are often used in algorithms and modeling due to their unique mathematical properties.
